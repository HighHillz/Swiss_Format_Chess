 â”— ðŸ“„ README.md                # Youâ€™re looking at it ðŸ˜Ž (Current version details)
```

## How to Run
- First of all, ensure that the latest version of Python and MinGw C++ compiler are installed.
- To start the application, run the `compiler.py` file.

## Roadmap
- [x] CSV generation
- [x] Calculate number of rounds
- [x] Matchmaking algorithm
- [ ] **Progressing the tournament (start round, set winners, end round)**
- [ ] Score tracking
- [ ] Next round behaviours
- [ ] Tie breakers
- [ ] Tournament end card
