## File Structure
```bash
ï¿½ðŸ“‚ Swiss Format Manager
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ data
 â”ƒ  â”— ðŸ“„ test.csv              # Stores all player data
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ include                  # Contains all header files
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ scripts                  
 â”ƒ  â”— ðŸ“„ compiler.py           # Compiles all C++ files and runs the exe file if needed
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ source 
 â”ƒ  â”£ðŸ“„ main.cpp               # Main driver file
 â”ƒ  â”£ðŸ“„ csvreader.cpp          # Connects the tool with the csv file (read and write)
 â”ƒ  â”£ðŸ“„ players.cpp            # Defines a player object
 â”ƒ  â”£ðŸ“„ matchmaking.cpp        # Contains the main matchmaking algorithm
 â”ƒ  â”£ðŸ“„ round.cpp              # Responsible for starting the round, setting results and going to the next round
 â”ƒ  â”—ðŸ“„ tournament.cpp         # Application that connects all units together to make the project

```

## How to Run
- First of all, ensure that the latest version of Python and MinGw C++ compiler are installed.
- To start the application, run the `scripts/compiler.py` file.
